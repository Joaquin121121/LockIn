# Timer Sounds

Place the following MP3 files in this directory to enable the timer sounds:

1. `timer-complete.mp3` - Played when a timer completes
2. `lock-in.mp3` - Played when starting a "Lock In" timer session

You can use any audio files of your choice. Some options include:

- Download free sounds from websites like Mixkit, Freesound, or Soundsnap
- Use your system's built-in notification sounds
- Record custom sounds

The sounds will play automatically:

- `lock-in.mp3` when you press START on a Lock In timer
- `timer-complete.mp3` when any timer completes
